Usability Reviews:
Makenna Avakian (8:00 AM 04/30/2018) - I was very impressed with the login page, and the video. It is a very novel idea. When in the actual site, some of the links did not work immediately when clicked on, and when creating a new person to keep track of, their screen name came out funky. Overall it was easy to use, and fun to explore.
Michael Brunetti (8:30 AM 04/30/2018) - Neat idea, seems to work fairly well! If you were to develop this further into an app, I'd recommend adding more options for interactions.
Zack Bellomo (8:50 AM 04/30/2018) -
Site was easy to use and understand. Provides a service that I believe is necessary for people to build long lasting relationships. It is a unique idea that is unlike any other social media app I’ve used before.
Sree (8:50 AM 04/30/2018) - This website could use some more work, but overall it has a lot of potential concept-wise.
