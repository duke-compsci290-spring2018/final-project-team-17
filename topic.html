      Final Project Topic
    </h1>
    <h2>How many times has someone asked you "Hey, long time no see. We should get coffee sometime" or something similar and never followed through? Have you been guilty of doing this yourself?</h2>

    <p>
      While most of our daily lives are consumed by school, work, pursuit of financial independence, or a combination of all three, we sometimes neglect to maintain a healthy balance of an inclusive social life consisting of fruitful relationships with those who we appreciate the most.
      <br>
      <br>
      Having a healthy social life is known to <strong>improve mental health</strong> and even <strong>increase your lifespan</strong>.
      <br>
      <br>
      To facilitate the process of improving people's social lives, we will create a website that allows you to meticulously shape your relationships with other people the way you want them to be, whether it be 100 people, ten people, or even a single person. It's not the amount that matters, but the <strong>depth</strong> of each relationship.
      <br>
      <br>
      Our website will allow you to
      <ul>
        <li>create reminders to notify you of upcoming relationship-boosting tasks, ranging from a simple phone call to an immersive activity...</li>
        <li>keep track of any upcoming events and special occasions that your friends of family might have...</li>
        <li>merge your calendar with your acquaintances' calendars, with their permission...</li>
        <li>and manage records of things you've lent to someone or things others have lent to you.</li>
      </ul>

      To achieve these tasks, we will develop
      <ul>
        <li>novel algorithms to determine the best time for you to chat with your acquaintances to maximize positive relationship growth...</li>
        <li>and regular text or email reminders to help you keep up with your relationships.</li>
      </ul>

      As we come up with new ideas, the list will increase in size.

      <br>
      <br>

      We will be using a Node.js stack to build our application, with an emphasis on user experience. For now, we plan on having all of our data come from user input, but we may utilize other data sets to potentially train models that we use in our code for certain tasks, such as optimal reminders.
